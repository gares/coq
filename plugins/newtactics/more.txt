Example:
       move => + /invert /[ x y H | + H1 H2 | *- | toto_^- | -^1 ]
       move => [ ^toto | .. ]
       =>  [H1|H2]
       =>  /invert /[H1|H2]    
       =>  /invert [H1|H2]   
       =>  /eqP H - H2
       case: H => x1 x2 - H

  C : forall n (H: P n), Q (S n)
   
   toto_n
   toto_H

  R := { foo : _; bar : _ }
    toto_foo
    toto_bar

   >   enters fast introduction mode: only non-dependent 
       variables are considered by the following intropatterns
       (remark: fast mode does not change the semantics of * and *-).

   <   goes back to slow introduction mode: all variables are 
   

   Note that ">" and "<" and "/" and "[" and "]" act as separators 
   and need not be separated by spaces. In particular, this allows 
   to write "move =>> H".

   Note that the "fast/slow" mode does distribute inside the bracket:
   we go back to slow mode inside the bracket. However, it is not hard 
   to re-enter fast mode in the brackets on a per-need basis, e.g.:
       move =>> ~invert ~[x y H | > H1 H2]
